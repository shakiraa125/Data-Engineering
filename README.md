## Train Data Operations
This project focuses on analyzing train operation data to identify key trends, patterns, and actionable insights. By leveraging Snowflake's data processing capabilities, the dataset was cleaned, standardized, and analyzed efficiently. Key insights such as the most popular stations, peak operating days, and high-traffic routes were visualized using advanced tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These insights are intended to optimize train scheduling, resource allocation, and operational efficiency. The project demonstrates the potential of data-driven decision-making to enhance overall train network performance and passenger satisfaction.
